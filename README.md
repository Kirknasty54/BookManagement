This was originally based on my final project for Python Programmming II. I developed onto it using Customtkinter GUI to give it a modern and more satisfying feel with sqlite3 based databases. Used hashing to help hash and secure user passwords.

Might implement some form of recommendation system for users based on currently borrowed and previously borrowed books, will have to implement some form of machine leanring but what model I'm not sure yet

Also working on a chat room function with direct messaging capabiltiies
